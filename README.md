# Python For Intuitive Math

Learn and study math/physics with Python. This project started as IPython Notebook on Google Colab 
to help demonstrating and understanding Math/Physics concepts with interactive graphing, 
visualization, data analysis & simulation. 

For better accessiblity through web browser, the project is switched to utilize 
streamlit instead. It is currently deployed onto two cloud servers:
- Hugging Face Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jess-dudu/IntuitiveMath 
- Streamlit Cloud Server: https://pythonforintuitivemath.streamlit.app/ 

Here are some topics created:
- Quadratics and Optimization
- Hyperbolic Functions
- Analytic Geometry
- Differential Equations
- Uniformly Accelerated Motion
- Loan/Mortgage Calculator
