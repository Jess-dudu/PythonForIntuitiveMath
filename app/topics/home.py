         This project started with IPython Notebook on Google Colab to help demonstrating 
         and understanding Math topics with interactive graphing, visualization, data 
         analysis & simulation. For better accessiblity and interaction, it is 
         switched to utilize streamlit and deployed onto two free cloud servers:

         - HuggingFace Cloud Server (so far, apps respond faster):  
           - https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jess-dudu/IntuitiveMath
         - Streamlit Community Server (usually need to wait for apps to be brough up):  
           - https://pythonforintuitivemath.streamlit.app/
