# Python For Intuitive Math

Learn and study math/physics with Python. This project started with IPython Notebook 
to help demonstrating and understanding Math topics with interactive graphing, 
visualization, data analysis & simulation. 

For better accessiblity through web browser, the project is switched to utilize 
streamlit instead. It is deployed on two cloud servers:
- Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jess-dudu/IntuitiveMath 
- Streamlit cloud server: https://pythonforintuitivemath.streamlit.app/ 

Here are some topics created:
- Quadratics and Optimization
- Hyperbolic Functions
- Analytic Geometry
- Uniformly Accelerated Motion
- Loan/Mortgage Calculator
