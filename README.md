# Python For Intuitive Math

Learn and study math/physics with Python. This project started with IPython Notebook 
to help demonstrating and understanding Math topics with interactive graphing, 
visualization, data analysis & simulation. 

For better accessiblity through web browser, the project is switched to utilize 
streamlit instead. It is accessible through streamlit cloud server at
https://pythonforintuitivemath.streamlit.app/ 

Here are some topics I created:
- Quadratics and Optimization
- Hyperbolic Functions
- Analytic Geometry
- Loan/Mortgage Calculator
